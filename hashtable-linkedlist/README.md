HashTable with singly-linked list

PA5: use C++ linked lists to implement a data structure we have studied in this class: a hash table.

In v1, I create a list class to follow OOP convention. 
In v2, I simply use static funcions instead. 
I think static functions are conciser and clearer.
    
lab12 and lab13 are to implement some functions that operate on C++ linked lists.
